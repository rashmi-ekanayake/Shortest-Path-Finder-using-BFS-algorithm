Shortest Path Finder (BFS Maze Solver)

A terminal-based Python application that visualizes the shortest path through a maze using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
The project utilizes the curses library to create an animated maze traversal, starting from the "O" and ending at the "X".

Features

Implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm
Real-time terminal visualization using curses
Maze walls, paths, and visited nodes are color-coded
Avoids obstacles and finds the shortest valid route

Requirements

Python 3.x
curses (Built-in on Unix-based systems)

                  pip install windows-curses   (For Windows)
